x canary test
x process_empty text

x process_text 'hello'
x process_text "blah" which we will consider wrong spelling and expect "[blah]" as response

x process_text takes "hello there" and returns "hello there"
x process_text takes "hello tyop" and returns "hello [tyop]"
x process_text takes "misp hello" and returns "[misp] hello"

x process_text takes "hello tyop there misp" and returns "hello [tyop] there [misp]"

x process_text takes text with two lines and returns text with two lines
x process_text takes text with two lines with some incorrect spelling words and returns appropriate result

x process_text takes text with three lines and returns text with three lines
x process_text takes text with three lines with some incorrect spelling words and returns appropriate result

x process_text takes text "hello there how aare you" but runs into an exception from the spellchecker when looking up spelling for there

x getresponse for a word returns a value

x parseresponse returns a true value
x parseresponse returns a false value

x is_spelling_correct calls get_response and parse_response to check the spelling
x is_spelling_correct passes on the exception from get_response

x let's create the UI
